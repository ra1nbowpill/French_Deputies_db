# French_Deputies_db :globe_with_meridians:

This python script aim at extracting informations about french deputies from this website [French National Assembly](http://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr).

This script was made to be used by association but everyone is pleased to use this script. I am in no way responsible of how the informations collected are used.
